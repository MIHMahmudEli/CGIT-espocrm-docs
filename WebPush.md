# Web Push Notifications — deployment, configuration and limits

Custom module for EspoCRM 10.x. Everything lives under `custom/` and
`client/custom/`, so an EspoCRM upgrade does not overwrite it.

---

## 1. What it does

Two independent delivery paths share one API:

| Path | Trigger | Survives browser closing? |
|------|---------|----------------------------|
| **A — in-app** | `NotificationService::notifyUser()` writes a `notification` row and submits a WebSocket refresh | No — visible only while a session is open |
| **B — Web Push** | The same call forwards the payload to the push service (FCM/Mozilla), which hands it to the operating system | Yes — while the service worker is registered for that browser profile |

`CallRouteReminders` and any future producer call **one** method,
`NotificationService::notifyUser(...)`. There is no Web Push logic inside the
jobs, and no `setTimeout`/`setInterval`/polling anywhere in the delivery chain.

Nothing in this module is Windows-specific.

---

## 3. Production deployment checklist

1. **HTTPS is mandatory.** `serviceWorker` registration, `PushManager.subscribe()`
   and `Notification.requestPermission()` are all blocked on insecure origins
   (the browser exposes them as *insecure context*). `http://localhost` is the
   only exception a browser makes.
2. **Serve the app from the domain root** (or know your base path). The service
   worker is registered as `basePath + 'sw.js'` with `scope: basePath`, so
   `public/sw.js` must answer at `<base>/sw.js`.
3. **Generate the VAPID key pair** (once):

   ```
   php command.php web-push-generate-vapid-keys --subject=mailto:ops@example.com
   ```

   This writes `data/webpush-config.php`. Keep the file private — it holds the
   private key. `data/` must not be web-reachable.
4. **Or set environment variables** (they take precedence over the file, all
   three must be present):

   ```
   VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=<base64url 65-byte P-256 key>
   VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=<base64url 32-byte scalar D>
   VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:ops@example.com
   ```

   Set them for **both** Apache/FPM and the CLI that runs the scheduler, or the
   web path and the cron path will use different keys and every subscription
   will break.
5. **Rebuild metadata** after installing or upgrading the module:

   ```
   php rebuild.php
   php clear_cache.php
   ```
6. **Confirm the scheduler runs every minute.** `CallRouteReminders` is
   registered with `* * * * *`. The cron entry EspoCRM already uses is enough:

   ```
   * * * * * php /path/to/espocrm/cron.php > /dev/null 2>&1
   ```
7. **Master switch.** Web Push is on unless `webPushEnabled` is explicitly
   `false` in `config.php`. Leaving the key absent keeps it enabled.
8. **Rotation.** Rotating the VAPID pair invalidates *every* stored
   subscription; each browser must re-subscribe (click the navbar toggle off,
   then on). Rotate both halves together, never one.
9. **Migration.** No manual SQL. `PushSubscription` and the
   `Preferences.webPushMutedCategories` field are created by the rebuild.
   If you deploy by copy rather than install, run the rebuild before use.

---

## 4. Localhost testing

* `http://localhost/...` is accepted by browsers as a secure origin — push
  works without a certificate.
* `http://127.0.0.1/...` also works. `http://my-machine/` (plain host name over
  HTTP) does **not**.
* Clearing site data removes the service worker registration; re-enable the
  toggle after clearing.
* To watch the wire without a real push service, point the sender at a local
  endpoint during development — the integration suite does exactly this with a
  `php -S` router that returns `201`, `410` and `429` so success, expired
  subscription and transient failure can all be exercised.

---

## 5. Browser support

| Browser | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Chrome / Edge (Windows, macOS, Linux) | Supported — verified |
| Firefox (Windows, macOS, Linux) | Supported by spec; uses Mozilla's push service |
| Safari 16.4+ (macOS, iOS) | Supported by spec; requires an Apple developer certificate on iOS |
| Internet Explorer, legacy Edge | Not supported (no Service Worker / Push API) |
| Any browser over plain HTTP (non-localhost) | Not supported |

Requirements: Service Worker + Push API + Notifications API. The client checks
all three and shows *"This browser does not support desktop notifications"*
when they are missing.

---

## 6. API reference

All under `/api/v1/PushSubscription/action/…`, authenticated as usual.

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| GET | `vapidPublicKey` | Base64url public key for `applicationServerKey` |
| GET | `status` | `enabled`, `configured`, subscription count, permission |
| GET | `preferences` | `{"mutedCategories":[…]}` |
| POST | `preferences` | Save muted categories |
| POST | `subscribe` | Body: `{endpoint, keys:{p256dh, auth}, expirationTime, deviceName}` |
| POST | `unsubscribe` | Body: `{endpoint}` |
| POST | `sendTest` | Fires one push at the calling user's devices |

`sendTest` response:

```jsonc
{ "result": "success", "sent": 2, "success": true, "summary": "…" }
{ "result": "skipped", "error": "muted",          "sent": 0, "success": false }
{ "result": "failed",  "error": "notConfigured",  "sent": 0, "success": false }
{ "result": "failed",  "error": "noSubscription", "sent": 0, "success": false }
```

### User-facing control

The navbar bell has one control: **Enable desktop notifications**. It is the
only place `Notification.requestPermission()` is ever called — permission is
never requested automatically on page load. Clicking it again disables
notifications for that browser (subscription removed server-side).

---

## 7. Backend integration guide

```php
use Espo\Custom\Notification\NotificationService;

/** @var NotificationService $notify */
$notify = (new \Espo\Core\InjectableFactory($container))
    ->create(NotificationService::class);

$notify->notifyUser($userId, [
    'message'     => 'Invoice INV-1042 was approved.',
    'entityType'  => 'Invoice',
    'entityId'    => $invoiceId,
    'entityName'  => 'INV-1042',
    'url'         => '#Invoice/view/' . $invoiceId,
], [
    'actionId'   => 'invoice.approved.' . $invoiceId, // dedup key
    'category'   => 'invoice',
    'pushTitle'  => 'Invoice approved',
    'pushBody'   => 'INV-1042 was approved.',
    'ttl'        => 3600,
    'urgency'    => 'normal',
    'tag'        => 'invoice-' . $invoiceId,
]);

$notify->notifyUsers($userIds, $data, $options); // per-recipient dedup keys
```

Options accepted by `notifyUser()`: `actionId`, `related`, `popup`,
`persistent`, `webPush`, `webSocket`, `pushTitle`, `pushBody`, `category`,
`payloadType`, `tag`, `ttl`, `urgency`.

**Deduplication.** `actionId` is unique per user. When a row with the same
`(user_id, action_id)` exists, nothing is created and nothing is pushed — so a
scheduler running every minute produces exactly one notification. Keys longer
than 36 characters are hashed (the column is `varchar(36)`), so long composite
keys are safe. `notifyUsers()` derives a per-recipient key automatically.

**Muting.** `category` is checked against the user's
`Preferences.webPushMutedCategories`. A muted category still creates the
in-app notification; only Path B is suppressed.

---

## 8. Data model

```
push_subscription
  id, assigned_user_id, endpoint (unique), key_p256dh, key_auth,
  expiration_time, device_name, user_agent, active (bool),
  last_used_at, created_at, modified_at, deleted

notification
  …, action_id varchar(36)   // dedup key, added by this module

preferences
  webPushMutedCategories (json array)   // added by this module
```

Expired subscriptions (`expiration_time` in the past or `active = 0`) are
filtered out on read. A `410 Gone` from the push service deactivates the row
immediately; a `404` does the same. Rows are never hard-deleted by the sender,
so a transient outage cannot destroy a working subscription.

---

## 9. Limitations — read before promising anything

* **Delivery with the browser fully closed is not guaranteed.** The push service
  only delivers while the browser's push connection is alive. Chrome and Edge
  on desktop keep that connection open when the browser is closed and use a
  platform service to show the notification; Firefox behaves differently, and
  some configurations, enterprise policies, or "continue running background
  apps" being disabled will stop it. **Test on the target machine before
  relying on it.**
* A push is **best effort**, not a queue. `ttl` (default 24 h unless set) bounds
  how long the push service may hold a message; after that it is dropped.
* One subscription per browser profile per origin. Multiple profiles or
  machines get multiple subscriptions; `sendTest` reports how many were
  targeted.
* The OS controls presentation: Windows focus assist, macOS Do Not Disturb, and
  per-site notification permissions can all suppress a visible banner while the
  push was still delivered.
* No at-least-once guarantee across a lost subscription: if the browser drops
  the subscription while offline, notifications stop until the user re-enables.
* `sw.js` must stay at the served root; moving it changes the scope and
  existing registrations become inert (fix by re-enabling the toggle).

## 10. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---------|-------|
| Toggle says "not configured" | `php command.php web-push-generate-vapid-keys`, then `php rebuild.php` |
| Subscribe succeeds, nothing arrives | `webPushEnabled` in `config.php`; browser push service reachability; `data/logs/espo-YYYY-MM-DD.log` |
| Nothing arrives with the browser closed | The limitation in §9 — verify on that machine with the browser closed |
| Duplicates return after a scheduler change | `actionId` changed; old rows keep their key, new rows get a new one |
| Permission prompt never appears | Only the navbar toggle requests it; check the browser's site permissions |
| Push works, in-app panel does not | WebSocket submission path, unrelated to this module |

---

## 11. Verification

Automated suites (run from the development machine):

| Suite | Covers |
|-------|--------|
| `webpush-infra-test.php` | VAPID, payload builder, preferences, subscription lifecycle, dedup, dispatch e2e with real decryption, scheduler, API routes, probe round-trip, cleanup |
| `webpush-frontend-check.mjs` | Service worker contract, no auto-prompt, manager API, navbar wiring, endpoints |
| `wp-meta-check.php` | Metadata / entityDefs / scriptList |
| `test-diff-hook.php`, `test-e2e.php`, `test-dup-iso.php`, `test-dup-source.php`, `dup-api-check.mjs`, `ui-api-check.mjs` | Regressions for the earlier History-diff and duplicate work |
| `task-prefill-meta.php`, `task-prefill-check.mjs`, `handler-unit.mjs` | Task prefill |
| `meeting-check.mjs` | Meeting History parity |

The final acceptance test — a **real OS notification while the tab and the
browser are both closed** — must be performed manually:

1. Open the CRM, click the navbar bell → **Enable desktop notifications**,
   accept the permission prompt.
2. Click **Send test** (or trigger a call reminder).
3. Confirm the banner appears with the tab focused.
4. Close the tab, then close the browser entirely.
5. Trigger another notification.
6. Confirm the OS banner still appears. If it does not on that machine, that is
   the limitation in §9 — not a defect in the module.
